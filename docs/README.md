# strength-board

### Web Application description

- dashboard with different panels that track gym-progress
- panels might be bar graphs, line charts to compare progress
- other features might be:
    - calender with days marked if you exercised
    - leaderboard in groups

### Why the app?

Users need a complete overview of their progress. With everything in one place, they can work on themselves more easily.
Also, with features like a leaderboard and a calender, they will be motivated to work even harder.

### How to get started?

At first only web-application due to my lack of knowledge, but eventually it will be an app on your phone. Just download it from the app store or enter this url: [Strength Board](https://www.webpagetest.org/blank.html).

### Where to get help?

An FAQ will be on the website. 

### Who is the contributor?
